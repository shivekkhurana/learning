###Problem###

>An enthusiastic tourist just arrived in Delhi & wishes to visit attractions like Red Fort, Dariba Kalan, National Museum...
>But as she is new in town, he is not acquainted with people &places of Delhi. Derive an optimal strategy for her to tour Delhi. 

This is a prototype of a ruby-sinatra web application that let's any tourist visiting Delhi to auto-generate her day's schedule based on her constraints(time, number of days of stay, etc..)

The schedule is pinned onto google maps and the user has option to decline locations which don't seem to be interesting.
